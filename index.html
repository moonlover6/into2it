    <h2>About the Girl Sitting Next to Me</h2>
    <p>Well, about a girl who is sitting next to me is that she is probably good at drawing.
        And interestingly she is doing her hobby even here, instead of studying and preparing for finals, LOL. I noticed this because from time to time she showed her drawings.
